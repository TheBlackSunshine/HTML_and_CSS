# HTML_and_CSS

This is an archive of the code snippets typed up from the book "HTML and CSS" by Jon Duckett.

This constituted my first exposure to the world of HTML, and I found it to be a fantastic intro. The content is excellent, split up sensibly to create just the right learning pace. The presentation is also fantastic with full colour rendered web pages and code snippets.

[I also began his other book "JavaScript & jQuery" but didn't get as far.](../../../JavaScript_and_jQuery)
